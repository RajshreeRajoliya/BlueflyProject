This is the Products page. We have implemented the sort and filter functionality using Higher order functions or First order function, like
map(), reduce(), filter(), forEach() etc. 

### 6. Side Slider Cart(Off canvas cart)
![hidden-cart](https://github.com/RajshreeRajoliya/BlueflyProject/blob/Rajshree/img%20for%20readme/off-canvas-cart.jpeg)

We have also implemented the off-canvas feature in our clone similar to the original website.
Once user adds anything from products page, it will start showing in the cart. 
User can interact with the cart items once they click on the cart icon, the side cart will appear.
They can use the buttons to update the quantity and see the price the product in real time.

We learned many things while we were implementing it.

### 7. Main Cart
![cart](https://github.com/RajshreeRajoliya/BlueflyProject/blob/Rajshree/img%20for%20readme/main%20cart.jpeg)

This is the page where user can access their cart items apart from side cart.
User can increase the quantity by using the input method or by typing it directly.
We are updating the price in real time by manipulating the DOM and utilising the HOF.

### 8. Shipping page

Once the user clicks on checkout button in the cart, they are redirected to this page to select shipping options.

### 9. Other information

## Challenges and Learnings

This is our first group project so we faced many hurdles and challenges.
Merging the codes on github, troublshooting, styling going wrong, functionalities not working as expected.
But we learned a lot from our mistakes. We utilised the proper resources and helped ourselves to build upon our foundation.
